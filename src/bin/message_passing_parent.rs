/*
* The socket is used for message passing IPC, but it is not used for shared memory IPC.
*
* Message Passing IPC (Uses Sockets)
*
  1. In message passing, processes communicate by sending messages to each other.
  2. A Unix domain socket acts like a virtual pipe where one process writes a message and the other reads it.
  3. Our code sets up a socket at /tmp/counter_socket, and both the parent and child process send/receive messages through it.
  4. This ensures strong isolation since processes do not directly access each otherâ€™s memory.
